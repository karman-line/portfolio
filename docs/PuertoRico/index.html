                        <p>Puerto Rico is expected to face another series of hurricanes this year. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, Puerto Rico saw an exodus of people to the United States as a result of wide-scale destruction.</p>
                        <p>For those still in Puerto Rico, a number of critical facilities and infrastructure are still lacking, causing people to continue migrating even months after Maria. Now there are thousands of abandoned homes in the region, with the population dropping dramatically.</p>
                        <p>This story will look at the various risks still faced by Puerto Rico, including hurricane risk, incomplete infrastructure rebuilding, coastal flood risk and so on.</p>

                     <h3>Why does this story matter now?</h3>
                     <br>
                     <li>The Biden administration plans to release $1.3 billion that was meant to help Puerto Rico rebuild after Hurricane Maria in 2017, and will remove restrictions on another $4.9 billion.</li>
                      <li>Puerto Rico is expected to be hit by hurricanes this year as hurricane season approaches, and is already experiencing unusual earthquakes.</li>

                      <h3>My role in reporting on this story</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>My research on Puerto Rico for another story brought me to the topic of concerns of vast migration of Puerto Ricans to mainland USA.</p>
                      <p>Through analysis of US census data (American Community Survey 5-year period) over 10 years, I quickly spotted that there was a rise in the number of vacant houses in every Puerto Rican municipality, a good indication of migration.</p>

                      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>To bring this story to life, we will use Altair and other Python tools to overlay housing unit data with areas prone to earthquakes and floods. Using <strong>Mapbox</strong> and <strong>Altair</strong>, we intend on creating a scrolly-piece of the problems faced by those left behind from the migration.</p>
